These scripts are provided for convenience because I use them occasionally to build and manage datasets and prefer to keep them all in one place. Use at your own risk.

image_crawler.py crawls a given URL and downloads all images on any linked pages it finds under the given URL.

small_images.py looks for image files below a given threshold and moves them to a folder.
